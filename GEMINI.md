This project

- use `bun` as dep manager
- use `make` instead of npm scripts as build system
- use`vite` as dev framework.
- use `vitest` as unit test framework

You should:

- only run specific test when necessary, skip coverage when testing.
- always run lint after code generating.
- avoid useless comments, be clean.
